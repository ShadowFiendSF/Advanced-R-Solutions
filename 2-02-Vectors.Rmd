# Vectors

## Atomic vectors

1. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: How do you create scalars of type raw and complex? (See `?raw` and `?complex`)

   __<span style="color:green">A</span>__: Length 1 raw and complex vectors can be created via `raw()` and `complex()`, i.e.:
  
    ```{r}
    raw(1)
    complex(1)
    ```
  
    For raw vectors it's easiest to coerce numeric or character scalars to raw:
  
    ```{r}
    as.raw(42)
    charToRaw("A")
    ```
  
    For complex numbers real and imaninary parts can be provided directly, i.e.:
  
    ```{r}
    complex(length.out = 1, real = 1, imaginary = 1)
    ```

2. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: Test your knowledge of vector coercion rules by predicting the output of
   the following uses of `c()`: 

    ```{r, eval=FALSE}
    c(1, FALSE)      # will be coerced to numeric   -> 1 0
    c("a", 1)        # will be coerced to character -> "a" "1"
    c(TRUE, 1L)      # will be coerced to integer   -> 1 1
    ```

3. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: Why is `1 == "1"` true? Why is `-1 < FALSE` true? Why is `"one" < 2` false?  
   __<span style="color:green">A</span>__: These operators are all functions which coerce their arguments (in these cases) to character, double and character. To
   enlighten the latter case: "one" comes after "2" in ASCII.

4. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: Why is the default missing value, `NA`, a logical vector? What's special
about logical vectors? (Hint: think about `c(FALSE, NA_character_)`.)  
   
   __<span style="color:green">A</span>__: It is a practical thought. When you combine `NA`s in `c()` with other atomic types they will be coerced
like `TRUE` and `FALSE` to integer `(NA_integer_)`, double `(NA_real_)`, complex `(NA_complex_)` and character `(NA_character_)`. Recall that in R there is a hierarchy of recursion that
goes logical -> integer -> double -> character.  If `NA` were, for example, a character,
including `NA` in a set of integers or logicals would result in them getting coerced
to characters which would be undesirable. Making `NA` a logical means that involving an `NA`
in a dataset (which happens often) will not result in coercion.

5. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: Precisely what do is.atomic(), is.numeric(), and is.vector() test for?
   
   __<span style="color:green">A</span>__: 
   
   __is.atomic__: Tests if `typeof()` is one of `"logical"`, `"integer"`, `"double"`, `"complex"`, `"character"`, `"raw"` or `"NULL"`.
   
   __is.numeric__: Tests if `typeof()` is integer or double and class is not one of `"factor"`, `"Date"`, `"POSIXt"` or `"difftime"`.
   
   __is.vector__: Tests if and object has no attributes, except for names and its `mode()` is atomic (`"logical"`, `"integer"`, `"double"`, `"complex"`, `"character"`, `"raw"`), `"list"` or `"expression"`.

## Attributes

1. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: How is setNames() implemented? How is unname() implemented? Read the source code.
   
   __<span style="color:green">A</span>__: `setNames()` is implemented as:
   
   ```{r}
   setNames
   ```
   
   As the data comes first `setNames()` also works well with the magrittr-pipe operator. When no first argument is given, the result is a named vector:
   
   ```{r}
   setNames( , c("a", "b", "c"))
   ```
   
   However, the implemention also means that `setNames()` only affects the names attribute and not any other more specific naming-attributes like the dimnames attribute for matrices and arrays.
   
   `unname()` is implemented in the following way:
   
   ```{r}
   unname
   ```
   
   It always removes names and dimnames attributes when they are set, except for data frames. Note that the documentation is currently not correct (R 3.5.1). `force == TRUE` doesn't remove the dimnames (names and row names) as `NULL` is always catched within the first condition of the underlying `dimnames<-.data.frame`:
   
   ```{r}
   `dimnames<-.data.frame`
   ```
    
2. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: What does dim() return when applied to a 1d vector? When might you use NROW() or NCOL()?
    
   __<span style="color:green">A</span>__: From `?nrow`:
    
   `dim()` will return `NULL` when applied to a 1d vector.
   
   One might want to use `NROW()` or `NCOL()` to handle atomic vectors, lists and NULL values (1 column, 0 rows) analog do a 1-column matrix / data frame. In these cases the alternatives `nrow()` and `ncol()` would return `NULL` (consistently to the behaviour of `dim()`). When subsetting data frames (interactively) this might be convenient as it is not affected by and hence more robust regarding the `drop = TRUE`-idiom:

    ```{r}
    NROW(iris[, 1, drop = TRUE])
    nrow(iris[, 1, drop = TRUE])
    NCOL(iris[, 1, drop = TRUE])
    ncol(iris[, 1, drop = TRUE])
    ```    
3. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: How would you describe the following three objects? What makes them different to `1:5`?

    ```{r}
    x1 <- array(1:5, c(1, 1, 5)) # 1 row, 1 column, 5 in third dimension
    x2 <- array(1:5, c(1, 5, 1)) # 1 row, 5 columns, 1 in third dimension
    x3 <- array(1:5, c(5, 1, 1)) # 5 rows, 1 column, 1 in third dimension
    ```
    
   __<span style="color:green">A</span>__: They are of class array and so they have a `dim` attribute.

4. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: An early draft used this code to illustrate `structure()`:

    ```{r}
    structure(1:5, comment = "my attribute")
    ```

   But when you print that object you don't see the comment attribute.
   Why? Is the attribute missing, or is there something else special about
   it? (Hint: try using help.) \index{attributes!comment}
    
   __<span style="color:green">A</span>__: From the help of comment `(?comment)`:  
    
   > Contrary to other attributes, the comment is not printed (by print or print.default).
    
    
   Also from the help of attributes `(?attributes)`:  
    
   > Note that some attributes (namely class, comment, dim, dimnames, names, row.names and tsp) are treated specially and have restrictions on the values which can be set.
   
   Apart of that, we can get it easily when we are more specific, i.e.:
   
   ```{r}
   bla <- structure(1:5, comment = "my attribute")
   
   attributes(bla)
   attr(bla, "comment")
   ```
    
## S3 atomic vectors

5. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: What sort of object does `table()` return? What is its type? What attributes does it have? How does the dimensionality change as you tabulate more variables?
    
    __<span style="color:green">A</span>__: `table()` returns a crosstabulation of its input. The result is an S3 table object, which is an array (implicit class) of integers (type) under the hood. Attributes are dim (dimension of the underlying array) and dimnames (one for each input column). The dimensionality equals to the number of unique values (accordingly factor levels) of the input arguments, i.e.:
  
    ```{r}
    dim(table(iris))
    sapply(iris, function(x) length(unique(levels(as.factor(x)))))
    ```
    
6. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: What happens to a factor when you modify its levels? 
    
    ```{r, results = "none"}
    f1 <- factor(letters)
    levels(f1) <- rev(levels(f1))
    ```
    
   __<span style="color:green">A</span>__: Both, the entries of the factor and also its levels are being reversed:
    
    ```{r}
    f1
    ```
    

7. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: What does this code do? How do `f2` and `f3` differ from `f1`?

    ```{r, results = "none"}
    f2 <- rev(factor(letters)) # changes only the entries of the factor
    f3 <- factor(letters, levels = rev(letters)) # changes only the levels of the factor
    ```
    
   __<span style="color:green">A</span>__: Unlike `f1` `f2` and `f3` change only one thing. They change the order of the factor or its levels, but not both at the same time.

## Lists

1. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: List all the ways that a list differs from an atomic vector.

   __<span style="color:green">A</span>__: 
   
   * Atomic vectors are homogeneous (all contents must be of the same type). Lists are heterogeneous (all contents can be of different types). 
   
   * Atomic vectors point to one value, while lists contain references which point to one value each:

      ```{r}
      lobstr::ref(1:3)
      lobstr::ref(list(1:3,2,3))
      ```
    
    * Subsetting with out of bound values and `NA`s leads to `NA`s for atomics and `NULL` values for lists:

      ```{r}
      (1:3)[4]
      as.list(1:3)[4]

      (1:3)[NA]
      as.list(1:3)[NA]
      ```
   
2. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: Why do you need to use `unlist()` to convert a list to an 
   atomic vector? Why doesn't `as.vector()` work?  
   __<span style="color:green">A</span>__: To get rid of (flatten) the nested structure. `as.vector()` doesn't work, because a list is already a vector.

3. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: Compare and contrast `c()` and `unlist()` when combining a date and date-time into a single vector.

__<span style="color:orange">A</span>__: 

```{r}
date <- as.Date("1970-02-01")
now_ct <- as.POSIXct("2018-08-01 22:00", tz = "UTC")
now_lt <- as.POSIXlt(now_ct)

c(date, date) # date method
c(now_ct, now_ct) # date_time_ct method
c(now_lt, now_lt) # date_time_lt method

c(date, now_ct) # date method
c(now_ct, date) # date_time_ct method

c(date, now_ct, now_lt) # date method
c(now_ct, date, now_lt) # date_time_ct method

```

## Data frames and tibbles

1. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: Can you have a data frame with 0 rows? What about 0 columns?  
   __<span style="color:green">A</span>__: Yes, you can create them easily. Also both dimensions can be 0:

    ```{r}
    # here we use the recycling rules for logical subsetting, but you could
    # also subset with 0, a negative index or a zero length atomic (i.e.
    # logical(0), character(0), integer(0), double(0))
    
    iris[FALSE,]
    
    iris[ , FALSE] # or iris[FALSE]
    
    iris[FALSE, FALSE] # or just data.frame()
    ```

2. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: What happens if you attempt to set rownames that are not unique?

    __<span style="color:green">A</span>__
    It depends on the object and how you attempt this. For matrices it will work without any problems. For data frames and using the `row.names<-` replacement function, no further arguments can be set and the underlying `row.names<-.data.frame` method will throw an error (and an additional warning):
   
    ```{r, error = TRUE, warning = TRUE}
    row.names(mtcars) <- rep(1, nrow(mtcars))
    ```
    
    However, by calling the underlying `.rowNamesDF<-` directly you can set the `make.names` argument to `NA`, which sets `seq_len(nrow(x))` as (integer) row names or to `TRUE`, which triggers a call of `make.names(value, unique = TRUE)` for constructing valid (character) row names.

3. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: If `df` is a data frame, what can you say about `t(df)`, and `t(t(df))`? Perform some experiments, making sure to try different column types.

    __<span style="color:green">A</span>__ Both will return matrices with dimensions regaring the typical transposition rules. As `t()` uses `as.matrix.data.frame()` for the preprocessing infront of applying `t.default()` and elements of matrices need to be of the same type, all elements get coerced in the usual order (logical << integer << double << character), while factors, dates and datetimes are treated as characters during coercion.

4. __<span style="color:red">Q</span>__: What does `as.matrix()` do when applied to a data frame with 
   columns of different types? How does it differ from `data.matrix()`?
    
   __<span style="color:green">A</span>__: From `?as.matrix`:
    
   > The method for data frames will return a character matrix if there is only atomic columns and any non-(numeric/logical/complex) column, applying as.vector to factors and format to other non-character columns. Otherwise the usual coercion hierarchy (logical < integer < double < complex) will be used, e.g., all-logical data frames will be coerced to a logical matrix, mixed logical-integer will give a integer matrix, etc.
    
   To illustrate this, we create an easy example where the data frame gets coerced to a character matrix:

    ```{r}
    a <- c("a", "b", "c")
    b <- c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)
    c <- c("TRUE", "FALSE", "FALSE")
    d <- c(1L, 0L, 2L)
    e <- c(1.5, 2, 3)
    f <- c("one" = 1, "two" = 2, "three" = 3)
    g <- c("first" = 1, "second" = 2, "third" = 3)
    h <- factor(c("f1", "f2", "f3"))
    
    df_cols <- data.frame(a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
    
    # Note that format is applied to the characters, which can complicate
    # inverse conversion (back to the previous type).
    # For example TRUE in the b variable becomes " TRUE" (starting with a space)
    as.matrix(df_cols)
    ```
    
   From `?as.data.matrix`:
    
   > Return the matrix obtained by converting all the variables in a data frame to numeric mode and then binding them together as the columns of a matrix. Factors and ordered factors are replaced by their internal codes.
    
   So for `data.matrix` we'll get a numerix matrix containing `NA`s for original character columns:
    
    ```{r}
    data.matrix(df_cols)
    ```
